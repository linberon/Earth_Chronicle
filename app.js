			The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet, is broken into tectonic plates. 
			The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates and many minor plates. 
			Tectonic motion is believed to have begun around 3 to 3.5 billion years ago.
		</p>

		<p>
			The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, 
			including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents.
		</p>

		<p>
			Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40 mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as 
			fingernails grow), to about 160 mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows).
		</p>

		<p>
			The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are commonly 
			associated with earthquakes and the creation of mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and 
			oceanic trenches. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The majority of the world's active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the 
			Pacific Plate's Ring of Fire being the most active and widely known today.
		</p>

		<p>
			When plates collide or undergo subduction (that is – ride one over another), the plates tend to 
			buckle and fold, forming mountains. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The Himalayas, the world's tallest mountain range, are assumed to have been formed by the 
			collision of two major plates. Before uplift, they were covered by the Tethys Ocean.
		</p>

		<p>
			The current motion of the tectonic plates is today determined by remote sensing satellite data 
			sets, calibrated with ground station measurements.
